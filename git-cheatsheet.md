To find the branch in a version control system like Git on your computer, you can use the command line or terminal. Hereâ€™s how:

Using Command Line (Terminal)
Open Terminal: 

On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or Git Bash.
On macOS or Linux, open your Terminal application.
Navigate to Your Repository: 
Use the cd command to change to the directory where your Git repository is located. For example:


cd /path/to/your/repository
Check Current Branch: 
To see which branch you are currently on, use the following command:


git branch
This will list all branches in your repository, and the currently active branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

List All Branches: 
To see all available branches (both local and remote), you can run:


git branch -a
